  <h1 class="post-title">kinks in productivity</h1>
  <span class="post-date">18 Jul 2014</span>
  <p>I&#39;ve been rather unproductive these past few months, and I think I know
 the reason why, I&#39;m just not sure how to go about solving it. It&#39;s
 procrastination, the eternal foe again, and this time it&#39;s because of a
 fear of decision making.</p>

<p>I think that fear is a mix of different things; it could be self-doubt
 about if I&#39;m making the right decisions for myself, fear of looking stupid 
or saying the wrong thing, and fear of change.
  So stemming from those fears, I downloaded a bunch of games and played
 them all till the wee hours of the night.  Not quite the ultra productive
 summer I envisioned.</p>

<p>Amidst all this, I did actually help out with the house a bit by cleaning up my little corner upstairs, clearing out a bunch of clothes to go to goodwill (the clothes aren&#39;t in the room anymore, but they&#39;re not at goodwill yet, so they&#39;re in car purgatory at the moment), the website&#39;s blogging stuff is up and running, and I&#39;m chugging along with the Brother&#39;s Karamazov, so not everything is in vain. Still, there was a lot I wanted to accomplish to get to a point where I would&#39;ve been satisfied with myself, and really, there is still a chance that the proverbial ship can change direction and steer back into the right track, but I&#39;m finding myself in very familiar territory and feeling procrastination-deadline-y again.</p>

<h5>ALREADY FRIDAY</h5>

<p>So, even in just writing this post, I got tired at 2 am and went to sleep, so it&#39;s friday. Oh well.</p>

<h5>GOAT ME</h5>

<p>so I found <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2b0yf8/good_students_how_do_you_go_about_getting_good/cj0qre2">I found this reddit post</a> about how to make learning stick - with the amusing acronym of GOAT ME. I&#39;ll leave you to read the post, but the reason it struck me is that it seemed to draw the same conclusions as other ideas I&#39;ve found online - Tim Ferris, Cal Newport, and Scott H Young all seem to say very similar things with regard to learning. I should really apply that to my habit/productivity/process learning.</p>

<h5>NO TIME LEFT vs ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD</h5>

<p>There was another sentiment in that thread (and in another post I was reading about procrastination) about how the perception of how much time you have affects the amount of stuff you get done. If you perceive that you have all the time in the world, then of course you&#39;re gonna act like that - you&#39;ll never get to the important stuff because there&#39;ll always be an extra minute or hour somewhere where you can do that project or whatever. If you always operate under the idea of time scarcity, or just think that you will never have time again to do the important, will you do it? Again, I&#39;ve encountered this idea in a thousand different ways, but it never stuck for some reason. In the few hours I&#39;ve thought about it though, it seems I&#39;m a lot more motivated to do things when I think to myself that &quot;I will never have this time again&quot;. Maybe this time it&#39;ll work? We&#39;ll see.</p>
