title: Testing Screen Capture on Windows 8.1
---

  So apparently Windows 8/8.1 borked a lot of the simpler screen recording programs, so it took me a bit before I settled on Camtasia. Compared to the simpler screencap programs, the process of screen recording and uploading everything is two or three more steps longer, but being able to record everything including metro apps is great. Hopefully I can streamline this process way down so that things I'm working on can be uploaded quickly and make this a fun place. I'm using http://gfycat.com to host the screen recordings, because HTML5 videos are faster than gifs. 
  
* Screen Capture process:  
 1. Camtasia recorder - record screen  
 2. Camtasia studio - convert .camrec to .gif  
 3. Gfycat - upload .gif to Gfycat (results in hosted .gif and html5 vid)  
 4. github - post new .md file for blog and embed gfycat link.  
  

The actual screen cap is kind of useless, but it illustrates the fact that I can actually screen cap between both desktop and metro apps seamlessly.
