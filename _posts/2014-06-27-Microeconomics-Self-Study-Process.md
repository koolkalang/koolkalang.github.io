title: Microeconomics Self-Study Process
---

So I just finished up a Micro-economics test, and I'm glad that's over. Don't follow what I did:
* Wallow in discomfort for a month or two.
* Passively watch powerpoints, while thinking I'm being productive at *le Starbucks*
* Procrastinate effervescently

What did work however, toward the end of the studying stint, was taking the tests and seeing feedback either immediately 
or right after taking the test: I got to hone in ambgiguity much quicker, and things started clicking much faster.

All along this process, I was trying to implement what the internet has collectively taught me on how to study, and I could hardly
figure out what was wrong until I noticed something: There were a lot of 'entry' points to the subject matter, but from
those entry points I couldn't really get my head into the right thought process. If worded or presented differently I would
get it, but not from random jumping points. This may or may not prove to be important in the future, but we'll see.

Well it's time to focus on the next set of challenges. I'm slowly getting to a good operational point, where new things that come up can be easily handled and
I can maintain good progress in existing projects. This site, Trello, Syncing Email and Windows, github, bitbucket all funnel into this 'goal', and I hope that
I can get to that elusive 'goal' sooner rather than later.
