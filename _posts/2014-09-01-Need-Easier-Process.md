So, my current workflow is a bit bothersome, and it's a pain to just publish a blog post. Default github pages have it easy because you can publish things right on the github website, but I want my plugins, which won't work with default github. That means that I have to build my site locally first on my machine, and then move that 'build' into the master branch.

I've simplified a lot of the git commands, so instead of typing `git commit -m "message"`, I just use `commit "message"`. I guess I need to write something that will automatically rename the filename of this file, since that's the part that annoys me the most, maybe write it in python or something.  I can also do a lot more to chain the aliases together and make that process simpler.
