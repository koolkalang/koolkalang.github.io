I think I just recently realized that all of the major successful  bloggers that I follow all have that one similar pattern - they all write. That may be a total coincidence, since there are probably other people who are just as successful but don't ever put their work out in writing. 

Of course there's also a good possibility that writing is just another distraction from actually getting work done. Who knows.
