   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Godzilla at the Beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this is my first real post on this site. Whatever I&amp;#39;m making that&amp;#39;s presentable, may end up here in the future. We&amp;#39;ll see what happens! &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Microeconomics Self-Study Process</title>
   <link href="/2014/06/27/Microeconomics-Self-Study-Process/"/>
   <updated>2014-06-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/06/27/Microeconomics-Self-Study-Process</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I just finished up a Micro-economics test, and I&amp;#39;m glad that&amp;#39;s over. Don&amp;#39;t follow what I did:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wallow in discomfort for a month or two.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passively watch powerpoints, while thinking I&amp;#39;m being productive at &lt;em&gt;le Starbucks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Procrastinate effervescently&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did work however, toward the end of the studying stint, was taking the tests and seeing feedback either immediately 
or right after taking the test: I got to hone in ambgiguity much quicker, and things started clicking much faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All along this process, I was trying to implement what the internet has collectively taught me on how to study, and I could hardly
figure out what was wrong until I noticed something: There were a lot of &amp;#39;entry&amp;#39; points to the subject matter, but from
those entry points I couldn&amp;#39;t really get my head into the right thought process. If worded or presented differently I would
get it, but not from random jumping points. This may or may not prove to be important in the future, but we&amp;#39;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well it&amp;#39;s time to focus on the next set of challenges. I&amp;#39;m slowly getting to a good operational point, where new things that come up can be easily handled and
I can maintain good progress in existing projects. This site, Trello, Syncing Email and Windows, github, bitbucket all funnel into this &amp;#39;goal&amp;#39;, and I hope that
I can get to that elusive &amp;#39;goal&amp;#39; sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Testing Screen Capture on Windows 8.1</title>
   <link href="/2014/06/12/Testing-ScreenCap/"/>
   <updated>2014-06-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/06/12/Testing-ScreenCap</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So apparently Windows 8/8.1 borked a lot of the simpler screen recording programs, so it took me a bit before I settled on Camtasia. Compared to the simpler screencap programs, the process of screen recording and uploading everything is two or three more steps longer, but being able to record everything including metro apps is great. Hopefully I can streamline this process way down so that things I&amp;#39;m working on can be uploaded quickly and make this a fun place. I&amp;#39;m using http://gfycat.com to host the screen recordings, because HTML5 videos are faster than gifs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screen Capture process:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Camtasia recorder - record screen&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Camtasia studio - convert .camrec to .gif&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gfycat - upload .gif to Gfycat (results in hosted .gif and html5 vid)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;github - post new .md file for blog and embed gfycat link.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual screen cap is kind of useless, but it illustrates  the fact that I can actually screen cap between both desktop and metro apps seamlessly.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://test.gfycat.com/gfycat_test_may18.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gfyitem&quot; data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=true data-expand=true data-id=&quot;UnawareMinorDarklingbeetle&quot; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Personal Test</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is just a quick test to find out if the personal tags works as it should. If you find this page, it&amp;#39;s okay, it&amp;#39;s not entirely private, but I&amp;#39;d rather not have this stuff clutter up the front page. It&amp;#39;ll probably mostly just introspectives on my current projects and will be more diary/journal like, in contrast to the front page which I want to be more explanatory and structured.&lt;/p&gt;
