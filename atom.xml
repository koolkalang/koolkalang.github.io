   <title>Blogging In Four Steps</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, I did some work to try and streamline and take the headache out of pushing out a simple blog post. It involves a lot of aliases in .bashrc, and a rather crappy python script to automate the title posts.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;post&lt;/code&gt; -  brings up vim and opens a file simply called &amp;#39;post&amp;#39;. The first line is reserved for the title, and the second line is for tags, seperated by spaces. The rest of the file is simply the blog content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;review&lt;/code&gt; - This opens up a localhost version of the blog, and does a python script and a few git commands to get the source ready for commit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;commit&lt;/code&gt; - This is just a regular commit, but it needs a message with it to compile. I figured the comments on the source branch  would matter more than the commits on the master branch, so I just abstracted the master commit branch away in aliases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt; - Does a lot of the heavy lifting - it moves the generated _site foler to the master branch, automatically commits that, and pushes both the master and source branches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first post that uses this new process fully, so I hope that this new process makes me a more productive blogger.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: This post and review workflow seems to work very well, I hope I can use this a lot more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m doing stuff right now in this file, to do things in this file.
This is the second line in the content of the file. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder what else I should be doing here.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Need a better process to this blog/site.</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, my current workflow is a bit bothersome, and it&amp;#39;s a pain to just publish a blog post. Default github pages have it easy because you can publish things right on the github website, but I want my plugins, which won&amp;#39;t work with default github. That means that I have to build my site locally first on my machine, and then move that &amp;#39;build&amp;#39; into the master branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve simplified a lot of the git commands, so instead of typing &lt;code&gt;git commit -m &amp;quot;message&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, I just use &lt;code&gt;commit &amp;quot;message&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;. I guess I need to write something that will automatically rename the filename of this file, since that&amp;#39;s the part that annoys me the most, maybe write it in python or something.  I can also do a lot more to chain the aliases together and make that process simpler. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this is my first real post on this site. Whatever I&amp;#39;m making that&amp;#39;s presentable, may end up here in the future. We&amp;#39;ll see what happens! &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Microeconomics Self-Study Process</title>
   <link href="/2014/06/27/Microeconomics-Self-Study-Process/"/>
   <updated>2014-06-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/06/27/Microeconomics-Self-Study-Process</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I just finished up a Micro-economics test, and I&amp;#39;m glad that&amp;#39;s over. Don&amp;#39;t follow what I did:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wallow in discomfort for a month or two.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passively watch powerpoints, while thinking I&amp;#39;m being productive at &lt;em&gt;le Starbucks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Procrastinate effervescently&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did work however, toward the end of the studying stint, was taking the tests and seeing feedback either immediately 
or right after taking the test: I got to hone in ambgiguity much quicker, and things started clicking much faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All along this process, I was trying to implement what the internet has collectively taught me on how to study, and I could hardly
figure out what was wrong until I noticed something: There were a lot of &amp;#39;entry&amp;#39; points to the subject matter, but from
those entry points I couldn&amp;#39;t really get my head into the right thought process. If worded or presented differently I would
get it, but not from random jumping points. This may or may not prove to be important in the future, but we&amp;#39;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well it&amp;#39;s time to focus on the next set of challenges. I&amp;#39;m slowly getting to a good operational point, where new things that come up can be easily handled and
I can maintain good progress in existing projects. This site, Trello, Syncing Email and Windows, github, bitbucket all funnel into this &amp;#39;goal&amp;#39;, and I hope that
I can get to that elusive &amp;#39;goal&amp;#39; sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Testing Screen Capture on Windows 8.1</title>
   <link href="/2014/06/12/Testing-ScreenCap/"/>
   <updated>2014-06-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/06/12/Testing-ScreenCap</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So apparently Windows 8/8.1 borked a lot of the simpler screen recording programs, so it took me a bit before I settled on Camtasia. Compared to the simpler screencap programs, the process of screen recording and uploading everything is two or three more steps longer, but being able to record everything including metro apps is great. Hopefully I can streamline this process way down so that things I&amp;#39;m working on can be uploaded quickly and make this a fun place. I&amp;#39;m using http://gfycat.com to host the screen recordings, because HTML5 videos are faster than gifs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screen Capture process:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Camtasia recorder - record screen&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Camtasia studio - convert .camrec to .gif&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gfycat - upload .gif to Gfycat (results in hosted .gif and html5 vid)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;github - post new .md file for blog and embed gfycat link.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual screen cap is kind of useless, but it illustrates  the fact that I can actually screen cap between both desktop and metro apps seamlessly.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://test.gfycat.com/gfycat_test_may18.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gfyitem&quot; data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=true data-expand=true data-id=&quot;UnawareMinorDarklingbeetle&quot; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is just a quick test to find out if the personal tags works as it should. If you find this page, it&amp;#39;s okay, it&amp;#39;s not entirely private, but I&amp;#39;d rather not have this stuff clutter up the front page. It&amp;#39;ll probably mostly just introspectives on my current projects and will be more diary/journal like, in contrast to the front page which I want to be more explanatory and structured.&lt;/p&gt;
