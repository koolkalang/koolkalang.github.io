    <p>So, my current workflow is a bit bothersome, and it&#39;s a pain to just publish a blog post. Default github pages have it easy because you can publish things right on the github website, but I want my plugins, which won&#39;t work with default github. That means that I have to build my site locally first on my machine, and then move that &#39;build&#39; into the master branch.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve simplified a lot of the git commands, so instead of typing <code>git commit -m &quot;message&quot;</code>, I just use <code>commit &quot;message&quot;</code>. I guess I need to write something that will automatically rename the filename of this file, since that&#39;s the part that annoys me the most, maybe write it in python or something.  I can also do a lot more to chain the aliases together and make that process simpler. </p>

<p>So, this is my first real post on this site. Whatever I&#39;m making that&#39;s presentable, may end up here in the future. We&#39;ll see what happens! </p>

        Microeconomics Self-Study Process

    <p>So I just finished up a Micro-economics test, and I&#39;m glad that&#39;s over. Don&#39;t follow what I did:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Wallow in discomfort for a month or two.<br></li>
<li>Passively watch powerpoints, while thinking I&#39;m being productive at <em>le Starbucks</em><br></li>
<li>Procrastinate effervescently<br></li>
</ul>

<p>What did work however, toward the end of the studying stint, was taking the tests and seeing feedback either immediately 
or right after taking the test: I got to hone in ambgiguity much quicker, and things started clicking much faster.</p>

<p>All along this process, I was trying to implement what the internet has collectively taught me on how to study, and I could hardly
figure out what was wrong until I noticed something: There were a lot of &#39;entry&#39; points to the subject matter, but from
those entry points I couldn&#39;t really get my head into the right thought process. If worded or presented differently I would
get it, but not from random jumping points. This may or may not prove to be important in the future, but we&#39;ll see.</p>

<p>Well it&#39;s time to focus on the next set of challenges. I&#39;m slowly getting to a good operational point, where new things that come up can be easily handled and
I can maintain good progress in existing projects. This site, Trello, Syncing Email and Windows, github, bitbucket all funnel into this &#39;goal&#39;, and I hope that
I can get to that elusive &#39;goal&#39; sooner rather than later.</p>
