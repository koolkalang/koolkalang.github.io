						  ### C++ 
* the `delete` operator doesn't actually delete the object - it merely calls the desturctor, and tells the allocator that memory is free.
* For certain functions, apparently `Test::helloWorld(test); == test->helloWorld();` is valid, I'll have to look into this further, not quite sure what implications are for this.
* C++11 - use unique_ptr so that you don't have to delete afterwards.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

struct foo
{
	foo() { std::cout << "constructing" << std::endl; }
	~foo() { std::cout << "destructing" << std::endl; }
};

int main()
{
	std::unique_ptr<foo> p(new foo);
	// no need to remember to delete p
	return 0;
}
```
* This really confused me - once you initialize an object that has functions, those functions are slightly independent of the object/class. I'll have to dig deeper into this, because I am not entirely sure about the specifics. 

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>

struct Test {
	void helloWorld() {
		std::cout << "Hello, "<< this->me << "!" << std::endl;
	}
	
	std::string me = "World";
};

int main() {
	std::function<void(Test *)> helloWorld = &Test::helloWorld;
	
	Test test;
	helloWorld(&test);
	
	return 0;
}
```

### assumptions 
* learning about c++ doesn't mean that work is actually getting done on the project. 
* I should probably work on the individual functions separately first, and then refactor them into a class later if I have time.
* I spend 30 minutes researching why git couldn't connect to github.com, assuming it was a proxy issue. Turns out my laptop wasn't connected to the internet. Such a smart cookie I am.

						  This post is really just writing practice, so don't read into it too much. It's kind of bland, but you get an idea of what I like in motion design. 

I've really wanted to sink my teeth into both Cinema4D and After Effects, because the stuff people pump out on them just look visually stunning. Practically speaking, the market is saturated with people who know both programs, and so I'm only wanting to learn both programs because I want to make something like what I've been seeing online for the past few years. 
A few years ago, I stumbled on a video called flickermood that really sparked my interest in this motion design stuff.   

<center><iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/u3kYfeP76hA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>  

At the time typography was a big thing, and I hadn't seen something so fluid and dynamic as that video, since a lot of the typography at the time had clunky animation. Then I found Takuya Hosogane.

</center>

I was starting to become aware of Cinemaa4d around this time, and it seemed the people who used to do typography were slowly transitioning towards the 'motion design' aesthetic we usually see today, with tons and tons of squares, circles, and triangles. I particularly liked this guy because he blended 2d and 3d so well, as can be seen here:


<center>
<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/8837024" width="500" height="500" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/8837024">Vanishing Point</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/hsgn">Takuya Hosogane</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
</center>

e started looking into cinema4d more. I discovered Dave Lewandowski, who worked primarily with cinema4d and worked on features like tron and oblivion. I started to realize how powerful cinema4d really was, because a lot of his 3d work looks visually complex at times, and having played around a bit with cinema4d and its mograph package, it is disgustingly easy compared to all the animating work in maya. 

<center>
<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/54551393?title=0" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/54551393">Flying Lotus "Tiny Tortures" Process montage</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/dlew">dlew</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
</center>

I still admire these people to this day, because they have a kind of artistry that doesn't usually appear in mediocore visual effects.

Even though it's been years since I first got exposed to them, I've barely worked with either program. I dabbled a bit in after effects, but only ever got a super short clip from that. Currently I'm dabbling in cinema4d, and it's refreshing to be creating something new again. I figure it's better late than never, and I suppose now is a great time to jump in, especially with the abundance of good tutorials everywhere.  Here's the clip I made from after effects from a while ago - if I can make something short like this in cinema4d, I think it'll be worth it.

						<a class="tag" href="/tags/python/index.html">python</a>
					  
						<a class="tag" href="/tags/bash/index.html">bash</a>
					  
						  So, I did some work to try and streamline and take the headache out of pushing out a simple blog post. It involves a lot of aliases in .bashrc, and a rather crappy python script to automate the title posts.  

* `post` -  brings up vim and opens a file simply called 'post'. The first line is reserved for the title, and the second line is for tags, seperated by spaces. The rest of the file is simply the blog content.  
* `review` - This opens up a localhost version of the blog, and does a python script and a few git commands to get the source ready for commit.  
* `commit` - This is just a regular commit, but it needs a message with it to compile. I figured the comments on the source branch  would matter more than the commits on the master branch, so I just abstracted the master commit branch away in aliases.  
* `push` - Does a lot of the heavy lifting - it moves the generated _site foler to the master branch, automatically commits that, and pushes both the master and source branches.  

This is the first post that uses this new process fully, so I hope that this new process makes me a more productive blogger.  

EDIT: This post and review workflow seems to work very well, I hope I can use this a lot more frequently.

						  So, my current workflow is a bit bothersome, and it's a pain to just publish a blog post. Default github pages have it easy because you can publish things right on the github website, but I want my plugins, which won't work with default github. That means that I have to build my site locally first on my machine, and then move that 'build' into the master branch.

I've simplified a lot of the git commands, so instead of typing `git commit -m "message"`, I just use `commit "message"`. I guess I need to write something that will automatically rename the filename of this file, since that's the part that annoys me the most, maybe write it in python or something.  I can also do a lot more to chain the aliases together and make that process simpler.

						<a class="tag" href="/tags/process/index.html">process</a>
					  
						  So I just finished up a Micro-economics test, and I'm glad that's over. Don't follow what I did:  

* Wallow in discomfort for a month or two.  
* Passively watch powerpoints, while thinking I'm being productive at *le Starbucks*  
* Procrastinate effervescently  

What did work however, toward the end of the studying stint, was taking the tests and seeing feedback either immediately 
or right after taking the test: I got to hone in ambgiguity much quicker, and things started clicking much faster.

All along this process, I was trying to implement what the internet has collectively taught me on how to study, and I could hardly
figure out what was wrong until I noticed something: There were a lot of 'entry' points to the subject matter, but from
those entry points I couldn't really get my head into the right thought process. If worded or presented differently I would
get it, but not from random jumping points. This may or may not prove to be important in the future, but we'll see.

Well it's time to focus on the next set of challenges. I'm slowly getting to a good operational point, where new things that come up can be easily handled and
I can maintain good progress in existing projects. This site, Trello, Syncing Email and Windows, github, bitbucket all funnel into this 'goal', and I hope that
I can get to that elusive 'goal' sooner rather than later.

					  Testing Screen Capture on Windows 8.1

				  <span class="post-date">12 Jun 2014</span>
					  
						<a class="tag" href="/tags/process/index.html">process</a>
					  
						    So apparently Windows 8/8.1 borked a lot of the simpler screen recording programs, so it took me a bit before I settled on Camtasia. Compared to the simpler screencap programs, the process of screen recording and uploading everything is two or three more steps longer, but being able to record everything including metro apps is great. Hopefully I can streamline this process way down so that things I'm working on can be uploaded quickly and make this a fun place. I'm using http://gfycat.com to host the screen recordings, because HTML5 videos are faster than gifs. 
  
* Screen Capture process:  
 1. Camtasia recorder - record screen  
 2. Camtasia studio - convert .camrec to .gif  
 3. Gfycat - upload .gif to Gfycat (results in hosted .gif and html5 vid)  
 4. github - post new .md file for blog and embed gfycat link.  
  

The actual screen cap is kind of useless, but it illustrates  the fact that I can actually screen cap between both desktop and metro apps seamlessly.
